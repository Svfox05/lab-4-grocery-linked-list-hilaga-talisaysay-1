# CMSC123 Lab 4: GroceryListLinked

Implement the grocery list as a linked list! Implement these methods following the design recipe (be sure to include JUnit tests for each method!):

1. `add` - adds an item to the top of the grocery list
2. `remove(String name)`
3. `markAsBought(String name)`
4. `display()`

You may use your previously defined interface IGroceryList, but provide stubs for the functions you're not implementing yet.

Note: can you reuse tests you created previously for the ArrayList implementation?
